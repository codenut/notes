## Questions
1. For points spent that were cancelled by the customer by cancelling the order, should the points transaction still be displayed in the SPENT/CANCELLED and ALL tab?
2. For Pending Points that were cancelled, should the cancelled transaction still visible on any of the tabs?
3. How to handle partial cancel for both earn and redeemed points.
